## Getting Started

```
git clone https://github.com/Dorfnox/RTV1.git rtv1
```

### Installing

Running 'make' in the directory will install all dependencies and create the executable, 'rtv1'.

```
make
```

## Running the program

In order to open the program, please run the following.

```
./rtv1 shapes/cylinder.shape
```

You can change shapes/cylinder.shape to any of the other shape files.

To see a list of program commands, run:

```
./rtv1 -h
```

Press the 'i' key in the application to bring up user controls.

Any shape in the scenes can be clicked on with the mouse, and manipulated using the controls.

And that's it! Enjoy!
